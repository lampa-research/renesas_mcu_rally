# Renesas Virtual MCU Rally

Renesasâ€™ first virtual student contest is the perfect opportunity to combine practical learning and fun. Engineering students and their educators from universities all over Europe will build a self-guided MCU robot in the Renesas Virtual MCU Rally simulation environment and optimize the software that auto drives the robot along the white line on the track.
