## Specific rules

### Starting order penalty

The starting order, determined during the qualifying session, will influence the sprint race and the feature race. The robot starting first receives no penalty, while for every spot up to place 10, an additional weight of 0.1 kg is added to the robot, up to 0.9 kg total. Places 11+ will receive 1 kg weight penalty.

### Design

Each robot must have a distinct shape.
